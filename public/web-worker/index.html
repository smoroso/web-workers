<h2>Description:</h2>
<div>
  Mimics multithreading, allowing intensive scripts to be run in the background so they do not block other scripts from running.<br/>
  Ideal for keeping your UI responsive while also performing processor-intensive functions.<br/>
  Cannot directly interact with the DOM.<br/>
  Communication must go through the Web Workerâ€™s postMessage method.
