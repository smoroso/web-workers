# Description

A simple example of [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)

> A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.

A simple example of [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers)

> A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. The reason this is such an exciting API is that it allows you to support offline experiences, giving developers complete control over the experience.
